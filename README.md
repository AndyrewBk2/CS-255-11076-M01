Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project aimed to create a system for a transportation company to manage their drivers better. It included scheduling, assigning routes, tracking performance, and ensuring rule compliance, all to improve how they handle logistics.
What did you do particularly well?
I provided a well thought of plan on how to setup driverpass with no issues and create risk from security attacks. I also provide clear information on what is needed to come to create a very good system.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to improve something in my work on the DriverPass project documents, I'd focus on expanding the section that explains the specific features of the driver management system. This means giving more examples of how the scheduling and route assignment
modules work, explaining the user interface design, and highlighting any unique aspects of the system. Gathering feedback from users or clients would also help to make the description clearer and more detailed.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By reading what was needed for there system design and it is very important because they are going to be the ones running it. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I design software, like for projects such as DriverPass, I first learn exactly what the client needs by talking with them and looking over documents. Then, I study how the people who will use the software work, so I can make something that makes sense to them and solves their problems. I create early versions of the software to get feedback from users and make
improvements based on what they say. I also make sure the software can handle a lot of users using it at once. Throughout the whole process, my goal is to make software that's easy to use and does what people need it to do.
